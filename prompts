Hi ChatGPT! I’m working on theming my Hyprland setup with Wallust. Here’s what I’ve done so far and what I need help with next:
What I have done / set up:

    Installed Wallust and created the main config file ~/.config/wallust/wallust.toml with entries like:

backend = "kmeans"

[[entry]]
template = "waybar.css"
target = "~/.config/waybar/colors.css"

[[entry]]
template = "kitty.conf"
target = "~/.config/kitty/colors.conf"

[[entry]]
template = "gtk.css"
target = "~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"

[[entry]]
template = "wofi.css"
target = "~/.config/wofi/style.css"

[[entry]]
template = "nvim.vim"
target = "~/.config/nvim/colors/wallust.vim"

    Created the corresponding template files in ~/.config/wallust/templates/ with placeholders like {background}, {foreground}, {color0}, etc. For example, waybar.css with color variables used in the CSS.

    Updated my real config files to reference the Wallust-generated files:

        Kitty config includes colors.conf

        Waybar launched with -s ~/.config/waybar/colors.css

        GTK apps pick up ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css

        Wofi launched with --style ~/.config/wofi/style.css

        Neovim loads colorscheme wallust from generated vim file

    Created a script to automate wallpaper changing and theming:

#!/bin/bash

wallpaper="$1"

swww img "$wallpaper" --transition-type any --transition-duration 2
wallust "$wallpaper"

killall -q waybar
waybar -c ~/.config/waybar/config -s ~/.config/waybar/colors.css &
kitty @ set-colors -a ~/.config/kitty/colors.conf
# Add GTK reload or other commands as needed

What I want help with now:

    Confirm best practices for managing these configs — should I keep my existing Waybar or Kitty configs mostly unchanged and just point them to Wallust-generated files?

    How to handle Firefox theming dynamically (or best alternatives)?

    Any tips to automate this better on wallpaper change?

    Help with integrating random wallpapers and reapplying themes automatically

    Generate missing template files for apps I use (like kitty, waybar, wofi, nvim, gtk)

Thanks! Please guide me through the next steps or provide any scripts or configs I might need.
